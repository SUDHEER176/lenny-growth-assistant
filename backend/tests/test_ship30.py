High agency is the single rarest asset in tech.
When obstacles emerge, low-agency people report back that legal or security said no. High-agency operators refuse to let constraints dictate the outcome. Shreyas Doshi embodied this across Stripe, Twitter, and Google.
Here is why this matters today.

## 1. Problem Framing Is 80% Of The Job
High agency PMs don't accept problems as handed down by executives.
- **Re-examine the premise** before assigning sprint tickets.
- Meet 1-on-1 with cross-functional detractors to uncover hidden incentives.
- Eliminate feature factories.

## Actionable Takeaway
Tomorrow morning, conduct an agency audit: identify the single biggest roadblock on your roadmap and find a creative path around it rather than waiting for permission.
